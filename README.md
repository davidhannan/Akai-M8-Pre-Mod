# Akai-M8-Pre-Mod
Details of a pre-amp conversion for an Akai M8 amplifier

  Back in July of 2020 I found a craigslist ad for an Akai M8 and a Roberts 770x (the American version of the M8), along with a whole box of tapes. I was interested in reel-to-reel recorders at the time and the price was right ($125!!) so I decided to make the 4 hour drive to go pick them up. 

  They were in pretty good condition, considering their age (made in 1966), but they definitely needed some work. At the time I had next to no experience working on electronics, no less high voltage vacuum tube circuitry, but I think that the large size of the components and the point-to-point circuitry made the work a little easier for a beginner.

  I did some research on what types of things are normally done on old electronics like these, and I found out that the main thing to do is to replace the capacitors. I also learned that the power filter caps can be dangerous and that care should be taken to discharge them before doing anything inside the amps. The last, and potentially most interesting thing that I learned about these machines, is that their amplifiers can be converted into a two in one guitar and microphone pre-amplifier with relative ease. 
  
  I started work on the Akai machine first. I replaced all of the caps and the burnt out resistor. After doing so it was pretty much as good as new. I read that the amps are really nice and that they can be used by themselves if you put the machine into record mode, turn off the motor for the tape reels, and plug in an audio source to the line input, and so for the most part that is how I've been using the Akai for the past year or so, which left the Roberts 770x unused for all that time.
