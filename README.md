# Akai-M8-Pre-Mod
Details of a pre-amp conversion for an Akai M8 amplifier

  Back in July of 2020 I found a craigslist ad for an Akai M8 and a Roberts 770x (the American version of the M8), along with a whole box of tapes. I was interested in reel-to-reel recorders at the time and the price was right ($125!!) so I decided to make the 4 hour drive to go pick them up. 

  They were in pretty good condition, considering their age (made in 1966), but they definitely needed some work. At the time I had next to no experience working on electronics, no less high voltage vacuum tube circuitry, but I think that the large size of the components and the point-to-point circuitry made the work a little easier for a beginner.

  I did some research on what types of things are normally done on old electronics like these, and I found out that the main thing to do is to replace the capacitors. I also learned that the power filter caps can be dangerous and that care should be taken to discharge them before doing anything inside the amps. The last, and potentially most interesting thing that I learned about these machines, is that their amplifiers can be converted into a two in one guitar and microphone pre-amplifier with relative ease. 
  
  I started work on the Akai machine first. I replaced all of the caps and the burnt out resistor. After doing so it was pretty much as good as new. I read that the amps are really nice and that they can be used by themselves if you put the machine into record mode, turn off the motor for the tape reels, and plug in an audio source to the line input, and so for the most part that is how I've been using the Akai for the past year or so, which left the Roberts 770x unused for all that time.
  
  Fast forward to a few weeks ago (early February 2022), and I had been spending the majority of my spare time working on my modular synthesizer for the past year. My progress on that project had started to slow and I thought switching gears to a different project for a while might be good for me. I remembered that I still had the Roberts laying around and that I could do some mods to it's amplifiers. I tracked down the website that I remembered seeing that had all the details of the mods, and got to work.

  It sounds great! I added the optional gain control potentiometer for the 12AX7 but I didn't want to put another hole in the front panel so I put it through the empty tube socket hole that the right channel amp has(red knob). I plan on putting it inside a wooden enclosure sometime soon, I think it'll look really nice then. 
  
  You may have noticed that the amp in the picture is actually from the Akai (as noted on the VU meter). This is because I decided to swap out the right channel amp in the Akai machine with the right amp from the Roberts. The Roberts still had all the original paper in oil capacitors in it, and I wanted to see if I could tell the difference between the old caps that were still in the Roberts, and the new caps that I had put in the Akai. With headphones on, left ear listening to new caps, and right ear listening to old caps, I'd be lying to you if I said that I could tell a difference. At any rate, I left the Roberts amp in the Akai machine just for fun so I ended up doing the mods on the Akai amp that I took out of the machine.
